<p>I’m 26 years old. I am a veteran. I served 6 years in the Air Force as a radar, airfield, and weather systems technician while primarily working on navigational aids for pilots, aircrafts, and air traffic controllers. I also have prior experience as a field service engineer where I worked with automated camera inspection systems that were designed to deter defects in everyday bottles and cans. I have a degree electronic systems technology, some college in computer networks and cyber security.

<p> I'm 31 years old. I am currently studying to become a software developer. I served in the army for four years and earned my degree in human development after my military service. While working in the retail industry, I always looked for something new to learn in an IT related field and discovered a deep interest in programming languages during the onset of the pandemic.</p>
